# Device Monitoring

This folder contains examples of how to use the catalystwan sdk to monitor devices.

Device Monitoring information can be obtained from the following catalystwan sdk layers:
- Layer1: core interface. Provides a session object for interacting with SD-WAN Manager API. You  have to specify the API endpoint and parse the json response
- Layer3: user interface. Provides user-friendly objects for interacting with SD-WAN Manager API.

Examples with "-raw" are based on the layer1 core APIs.
